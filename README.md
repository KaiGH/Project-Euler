# Project Euler
![Statistics Badge](https://projecteuler.net/profile/KaiEuler.png)

This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler problems. I have implemented my solutions in C# console applications which were developed in Visual Studio. Feel free to view and download the code and compare it to your own solutions. 

## Repository Structure
* Project-Euler (Folder) - Contains all of the source code files for the project
  * ProblemXYZ.cs - Solution code to each particular problem
  * Program.cs - Terminal application allowing the user to choose the solution they want to run
* ProjectEuler.sln - Visual Studio project file
* Readme.md - Readme file written in Markdown
* Solutions.txt - List of answers genereated
 
## What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
